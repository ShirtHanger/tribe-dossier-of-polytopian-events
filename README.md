Since 2016 a unique little game (Which shall not be named (Just kidding I think they allow that)) helped me pass time and find joy in pretty awful parts of my life

My goal for this project: A website that shows off the various tribes of Polytopia (Owned and developed by Midjiwan) through the use of an API that I created for the use of this personal project. Displaying their lore and various facts about their culture outlined in Midjiwan's monthly "Tribe Moon" celebrations.

Many of my stretch goals involve intelligent use of the data in my API. Including
*   Sorting by paid tribes/special tribes
*   Actually getting the Youtube Player to work
*   Toggling between tribe skins
*   Randomizing lore tidbits, accompanied by images
*   A fourth "Strategies" model, where users can add to for each tribe via Axios.PUT
